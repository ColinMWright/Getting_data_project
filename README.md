Getting_data_project READ.me
====================

course project for coursera.org/getting data

The files X_test, Y_test, subject_test and X_train, Y_train and subject_train should all be in the current directory before running run_analysis.R

Also the file "features" should be there too, which labels the columns.

These are all text files from the project data folder, eg.

features<-read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt")

X_test<-read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt")
Y_test<- ...  etc.
